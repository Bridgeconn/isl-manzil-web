12,“You also must have a place outside the camp where people can go to relieve themselves.
13,"Among your weapons, you must also carry a stick to dig with. Then, when you relieve yourself, you must dig a hole and cover it up."
14,This is because the LORD your God is there with you in your camp to save you and to help you defeat your enemies. So the camp must be holy. Then he will not see something disgusting and leave you.

21,"“When you make a promise to the LORD your God, don’t be slow to pay everything you promised. The LORD your God will demand that you pay it. You will sin if you don’t pay what you promised."
