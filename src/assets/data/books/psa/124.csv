verse,text
1,"A song of David for going up to the Temple. What would have happened to us if the LORD had not been on our side? Tell us about it, Israel."
2,What would have happened to us if the LORD had not been on our side when people attacked us?
3,They would have swallowed us alive when they became angry with us.
4,"Their armies would have been like a flood washing over us, like a river drowning us."
5,Those proud people would have been like water rising up to our mouth and drowning us.
6,Praise the LORD! He did not let our enemies tear us apart.
7,"We escaped like a bird from the net of a hunter. The net broke, and we escaped!"
8,"Our help came from the LORD, the one who made heaven and earth!"
