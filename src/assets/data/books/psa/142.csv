verse,text
1,A maskil of David written when he was in the cave. A prayer. I cry out to the LORD. I beg the LORD to help me.
2,I tell him my problems; I tell him about my troubles.
3,"I am ready to give up. But you, Lord, know the path I am on, and you know that my enemies have set a trap for me."
4,"I look around, and I don’t see anyone I know. I have no place to run. There is no one to save me."
5,"LORD, I cry out to you for help: “You are my place of safety. You are all I need in life.”"
6,Listen to my prayer. I am so weak. Save me from those who are chasing me. They are stronger than I am.
7,"Help me escape this trap, so that I can praise your name. Then good people will celebrate with me, because you took care of me."
