verse,text
1,"Great blessings belong to those who don’t listen to evil advice, who don’t live like sinners, and who don’t join those who make fun of God."
2,"Instead, they love the LORD’S teachings and think about them day and night."
3,"So they grow strong, like a tree planted by a stream— a tree that produces fruit when it should and has leaves that never fall. Everything they do is successful."
4,But the wicked are not like that. They are like chaff that the wind blows away.
5,"When the time for judgment comes, the wicked will be found guilty. Sinners have no place among those who do what is right."
6,"The LORD shows his people how to live, but the wicked have lost their way."
