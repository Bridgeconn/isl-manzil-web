1,A song for going up to the Temple. Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion. They will never be shaken. They will continue forever.
2,"Like the mountains that surround Jerusalem, the LORD surrounds and protects his people now and forever."
3,"The wicked will not always control the land of those who do right. If they did, even those who do right might start doing wrong."
4,"LORD, be good to those who are good, to those who have pure hearts."
5,"But, LORD, when you punish those who do evil, also punish those who have stopped following your way. Let Israel always enjoy peace!"
