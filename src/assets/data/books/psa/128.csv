verse,text
1,A song for going up to the Temple. Great blessings belong to those who fear and respect the LORD and live the way he wants.
2,"You will get what you work for. You will enjoy the Lord’s blessings, and all will go well for you."
3,"At home, your wife will have many children, like a vine full of grapes. The children around your table will be like an orchard full of olive trees."
4,"Yes, the LORD will really bless those who respect him."
5,May the LORD bless you from Mount Zion. May you enjoy the blessings of Jerusalem all your life.
6,And may you live to see your grandchildren. Let Israel always enjoy peace!
