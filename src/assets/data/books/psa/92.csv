verse,text
1,"A song of praise for the Sabbath. It is good to praise the LORD. God Most High, it is good to praise your name."
2,It is good to sing about your love in the morning and about your faithfulness at night.
3,It is good to play for you on the ten-stringed instrument and lyre and to add the soft sounds of the harp to my praise.
4,"LORD, you make us very happy because of what you did. I gladly sing about it."
5,"LORD, you did such great things. Your thoughts are too hard for us to understand."
6,Stupid people don’t know this. Fools don’t understand.
7,"The wicked may sprout like grass, and those who do evil may blossom like flowers, but they will be destroyed, never to be seen again."
8,"But, LORD, you will be honored forever."
9,"LORD, all your enemies will be destroyed, and all who do evil will be scattered."
10,But you have made me as strong as a wild ox. You have given me your blessing.
11,My eyes will see the defeat of those waiting to attack me. My ears will hear the cries of my evil enemies.
12,Good people are like budding palm trees. They grow strong like the cedar trees of Lebanon.
13,They are planted in the house of the LORD. They grow strong there in the courtyards of our God.
14,"Even when they are old, they will continue producing fruit like young, healthy trees."
15,"They are there to show everyone that the LORD is good. He is my Rock, and he does no wrong."
