verse,text
1,"To the director: With flutes. A song of David. LORD, listen to me and understand what I am trying to say."
2,"My God and King, listen to my prayer."
3,"Every morning, LORD, I lay my gifts before you and look to you for help. And every morning you hear my prayers."
4,"God, you don’t want evil people near you. They cannot stay in your presence."
5,Fools cannot come near you. You hate those who do evil.
6,"You destroy those who tell lies. LORD, you hate those who make secret plans to hurt others."
7,"But by your great mercy, I can enter your house. I can worship in your holy Temple with fear and respect for you."
8,"LORD, show me your right way of living, and make it easy for me to follow. People are looking for my weaknesses, so show me how you want me to live."
9,My enemies never tell the truth. They only want to destroy people. Their words come from mouths that are like open graves. They use their lying tongues to deceive others.
10,"Punish them, God! Let them be caught in their own traps. They have turned against you, so punish them for their many crimes."
11,But let those who trust in you be happy forever. Protect and strengthen those who love your name.
12,"LORD, when you bless good people, you surround them with your love, like a large shield that protects them."
