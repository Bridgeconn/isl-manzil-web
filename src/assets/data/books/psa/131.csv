verse,text
1,"A song of David for going up to the Temple. LORD, I don’t feel proud. I don’t see myself as better than others. I am not thinking about doing great things or reaching impossible goals."
2,"No, right now I am calm and quiet, like a child after nursing, content in its mother’s arms."
3,"Israel, trust in the LORD. Trust in him now and forever!"
