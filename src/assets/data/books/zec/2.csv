1,Then I looked up and saw a man holding a rope for measuring things.
2,"I asked him, “Where are you going?” He said to me, “I am going to measure Jerusalem, to see how wide and how long it is.”"
3,"Then the angel who was speaking to me left, and another angel went out to talk to him."
4,"He said to him, “Run and tell that young man this: ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls, because there will be too many people and animals living there.’"
5,"The LORD says, ‘I will be a wall of fire around her, to protect her, and to bring glory to that city, I will live there.’” The LORD says,"
6,"“Hurry! Leave the land in the North in a hurry. Yes, it is true that I scattered your people in every direction."
7,You people from Zion now live in Babylon. Escape! Run away from that city!”
8,"The Lord sent me to the nations that took away your wealth. He sent me to bring you honor. And this is what the LORD All-Powerful said: “If anyone even touches you, it is as if they did it to the pupil of my eye."
9,Watch and see how I will punish them: Their own slaves will become their masters and take all their wealth.” Then you will know it was the LORD All-Powerful who sent me to tell you these things.
10,"The LORD says, “Zion, be happy, because I am coming, and I will live in your city."
11,"At that time people from many nations will come to me. They will become my people, and I will live in your city.” Then you will know it was the LORD All-Powerful who sent me to tell you these things."
12,The LORD will again choose Jerusalem to be his special city. Judah will be his share of the holy land.
13,"Everyone, be quiet! The LORD is coming out of his holy house."
