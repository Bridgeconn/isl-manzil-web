verse,text
1,"Then the LORD said to me again, “Gomer has many lovers, but you must continue loving her. Do this because it is an example of the LORD’S love for Israel. He continues to love them, but they continue to turn to other gods, and they love to eat those raisin cakes.”"
2,So I bought Gomer back for 6 ounces of silver and 9 bushels of barley.
3,"Then I told her, “You must stay at home with me for many days. You will not be like a prostitute. You will not have sexual relations with another man. I will be your husband.”"
4,In the same way the people of Israel will continue many days without a king or a leader. They will be without a sacrifice or a memorial stone. They will be without an ephod or a household god.
5,"After this, the people of Israel will come back and look for the LORD their God and for David their king. In the last days they will come to honor the LORD and his goodness."
