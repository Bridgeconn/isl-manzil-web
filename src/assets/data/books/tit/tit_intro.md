## AN INTRODUCTION TO THE EPISTLE OF TITUS

The book of Titus in the Bible is a letter written by Paul to Titus consisting of three chapters. Titus was a Gentile and a Co-worker of the apostle Paul among the non-Jewish people. In this letter, Paul called himself as servant of God and the Apostle of Christ. Apostle Paul accompanied Titus to the Crete Island which is the largest Island in the country of Greece. The reason Paul left Titus in Crete Island is to complete the unfinished work for the Churches.

### Duration and Place of Writing

The book was written approximately dated between A.D 62-65.

Paul wrote this letter to Titus from Nicopolis after he was released from his first imprisonment in Rome.

### Purpose of the Book

Paul’s advice to Titus is to correct the deficiency which is to do the needed things in the Church by choosing and placing good leader in the Church.
Leader's characters in the Church should be a good testimony, firm in teachings about Christ. Their Children and family should be Godly and be wise. So, that people outside the church will respect them and would not criticize them.

There were many false teachers in Crete Island. For that Paul tells Titus to teach clearly to the believers not to believe in their false teachings. And Titus has to teach people clearly that God made the Good News known through the coming of Our Savior Jesus Christ.
Near the end of the letter, Paul writes about God’s act of love through Jesus Christ Who saved us from our sin and make us His children. And he tells Titus to make sure everyone understands and follow the importance of the true teachings of Christ.
