1,"“When you give a grain offering to the LORD, your offering must be made from fine flour. You must pour oil on this flour and put frankincense on it."
2,"Then you must bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests. One of them will take a handful of the fine flour with oil and frankincense in it. He will bring this part, which represents the whole grain offering, to the altar. There it will be burned up as a sweet-smelling gift to the LORD."
3,The rest of that grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. This gift to the LORD is very holy.
4,"“If you give a grain offering that was baked in the oven, it must be unleavened bread made from fine flour mixed with oil, or it must be wafers with oil poured over them."
5,"If you bring a grain offering cooked in a baking pan, it must be made from fine flour without yeast and mixed with oil."
6,You must break it into pieces and pour oil over it. It is a grain offering.
7,"If you bring a grain offering cooked in a frying pan, it must be made from fine flour mixed with oil."

10,The rest of that grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. This gift to the LORD is very holy.
11,“You must not give any grain offering to the LORD that has yeast in it. You must not burn yeast or honey as a gift to the LORD.

13,"Also, you must put salt on every grain offering you bring. You must not forget to add salt, because it represents God’s agreement with you. Always put salt on these offerings."
