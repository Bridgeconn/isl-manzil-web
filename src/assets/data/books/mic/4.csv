verse,text
1,In the last days the mountain of the LORD’S Temple will be on the highest of all mountains. It will be raised higher than the hills. There will be a steady stream of people going there.
2,"People from many nations will go there and say, “Come, let’s go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. Then God will teach us his way of living, and we will follow him.” His teaching, the LORD’S message, will begin in Jerusalem on Mount Zion and will go out to all the world."
3,Then God will act as judge to end arguments between people in many places. He will decide what is right for great nations far and near. They will stop using their weapons for war. They will hammer their swords into plows and use their spears to make tools for harvesting. All fighting between nations will end. They will never again train for war.
4,They will sit under their own grapevine and fig tree. No one will make them afraid. That is because the LORD All-Powerful said it would happen like that.
5,"All the people from other nations follow their own gods, but we will follow the LORD our God forever and ever!"
6,"The LORD says, “Jerusalem was hurt and crippled. She was thrown away. She was hurt and punished, but I will bring her back to me."
7,"“The people of that ‘crippled’ city will be the only ones left alive. They were forced to leave, but I will make them into a strong nation.” The LORD will be their king. He will rule from Mount Zion forever."
8,"And you, Tower of Flocks, your time will come. Ophel, hill of Zion, you will again have the right to rule. Yes, the kingdom will be in Jerusalem as it was in the past."
9,"Now, why are you crying so loudly? Is your king gone? Have you lost your wise leader? Is that why you are suffering like a woman in labor?"
10,"Cry out, you people of Jerusalem, and feel the pain, as if you were giving birth. You must go out of the city and live in the fields. You will go away to Babylon, but you will also be saved from that place. The LORD will come and rescue you there. He will take you away from your enemies."
11,"Many nations have come to fight against you. They say, “Look, there is Zion! Let’s attack her!”"
12,"They have their plans, but they don’t know what the LORD is planning. He brought them here for a special purpose. They will be crushed like grain on a threshing floor."
13,"“People of Jerusalem, get up and crush them! I will make you very strong. It will be as if you have horns of iron and hooves of bronze. You will beat many people into small pieces. You will give their wealth to the LORD. You will give their treasure to the Lord of all the earth.”"
