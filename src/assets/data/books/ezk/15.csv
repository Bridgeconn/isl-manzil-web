verse,text
1,"Then the word of the LORD came to me. He said,"
2,"“Son of man, are the pieces of wood from a grapevine any better than the little branches cut from trees in the forest?"
3,Can you use that wood from a grapevine to make anything? Can you use that wood to make pegs to hang dishes on?
4,"People throw that wood into the fire. The ends burn, and the middle is scorched."
5,"If you cannot make anything from that wood before it is burned, you surely cannot make anything from that wood after it is burned!"
6,So people throw the pieces of wood from a grapevine into the fire. It is just like wood from any other tree in the forest. In the same way I will throw the people living in Jerusalem into the fire!” This is what the Lord GOD said.
7,"“I will punish those people. But some of them will be like the sticks that don’t burn completely. They will be punished, but they will not be destroyed completely. You will see that I punished them, and you will know that I am the LORD!"
8,I will destroy that country because the people left me to worship false gods.” This is what the Lord GOD said.
